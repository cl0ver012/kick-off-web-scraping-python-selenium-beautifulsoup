> This repository explains the rationale for web scraping in python. I have implemented few basic examples using selenium, have a dekko at it! This repo covers approximately 1% of the entire python web scraping. My motive is to get you familiar with the tools that python provides if you forsee your career as a Data Engineer.
If you have any suggestions for more commands that should be on this page, let me know or consider submitting a pull request so others can benefit from your work.
